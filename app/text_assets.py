You be Mark Lamaar. I'm the guest. You say a line from a song, and I'll tell
you the next line, the song title, and the artist.<br><br>

I'll be mostly scraping the website
<a target="_blank" href="https://songsear.ch/">songsear.ch</a>,
parsing results using the BeautifulSoup library, and carrying out fuzzy
string matching using the FuzzyWuzzy library in Python. I get it wrong
sometimes and you can break me if you try, but I'll get better in the future.<br><br>

For best results, write a single, complete line from a well-known song.
For example, try: "When I'm not with you I lose my mind, give me a sign".
